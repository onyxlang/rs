This is an [Onyx language](https://onyxlang.org) compiler implementation in Rust.
See the website for the brief history and language features.

## Zen

* Syntax exists for clarity.
  It shall be clear both conceptually and visually.
* Decrease ambiguity.
  * Syntax shall be unambiguous.
* Balance between multiple ways to do the same thing and syntax complexity (Rust is biased towards the number of special symbols).
* Subefficient unless transparently optimized.
